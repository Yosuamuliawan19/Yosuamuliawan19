### Projects

- **Musical Instrument Recognition using ML** - Research on windowing configurations, feature extraction methods, and ML classifiers for identifying musical instruments in polyphonic music. Trained models on the IRMAS dataset to detect individual instruments in a mix.

- **Tensormesh-go**  - Proof-of-concept distributed TPU communication simulator in Go. Implements parallel matrix multiplication and all-reduce operations, simulating OpenXLA ML compiler operations. ([link](https://github.com/Yosuamuliawan19/tensormesh-go))

- **Sentencepiece-go** - SentencePiece subword tokenization implementation in Go. Trains a tokenizer model from a corpus with a given vocabulary limit and supports encoding and decoding based on the SentencePiece specification. ([link](https://github.com/Yosuamuliawan19/sentencepiece-go))

- **AI Music Generation (LSTM)** - LSTM-based machine learning model for next-token music generation. Trained on classical compositions, incorporating data augmentation techniques like transposition and tempo variation for improved generalization. ([link]([https://github.com/Yosuamuliawan19/csmc_mume_polyphonic_instrument_classification/blob/master/MUME_2020___Submission.pdf](http://bit.ly/lstm-music-gen)))

- **RedditAtlas - Analyzing Subreddit Communities**  - Interactive Reddit analytics dashboard using NLP and big data processing. Analyzes a 269GB Reddit dataset with PySpark, Hadoop, and Google Cloud DataProc to identify trending topics and sentiment. Applies clustering algorithms to uncover subreddit relationships and engagement patterns. ([link](https://bit.ly/reddit-bigdata))
